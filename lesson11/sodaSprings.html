                <p>SODA SPRINGS — Air Idaho Rescue has been at the Soda Springs base since April of 2018.

                    Caribou County Sheriff Kelly Wells said the Air 5 crew has been incredible to work with and a
                    phenomenal resource.

                    “We are sad to see them leave our area,” Wells said. “Hopefully, they can establish a base in
                    Caribou County in the future.”
                    <br>

                    Air Methods officials have not announced when they will open the new base, but they did say they
                    will continue serving Caribou County even after, and there shouldn’t be any interruptions in service
                    at the dispatch center.
                    <br>
                    “Air Methods will continue to cover the Caribou County service area with other Air Idaho Rescue air
                    medical rotor wing and fixed wing aircraft,” according to the statement.

                    Officials hope they will not only be able to serve Caribou from their new base, but also Bannock,
                    Bonneville, Bingham, Butte, Fremont, Jefferson and Madison counties and surrounding areas. They say
                    the Idaho Falls base will result in quicker response times for emergent and trauma situations and
                    provide support for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit patients in cooperation with EIRMC’s NICU transport
                    team.
                    <br>
                    “EIRMC provides the highest level of NICU care in the region as the only Level III-B NICU in Eastern
                    Idaho, Western Wyoming and Southwestern Montana,” according to the news release, which adds that the
                    hospital can take babies as low as 22-weeks gestational age.

                    EIRMC is also home to Idaho’s only Burn Center and the region’s only Level I Intensive Care Unit,
                    according to the news release.

                    “As the largest medical facility in the region, and the region’s healthcare hub, we serve many rural
                    areas that require air medical services to address emergencies and save lives,” Jeff Sollis, CEO of
                    EIRMC, said in the news release. “Serving southeast Idaho, western Wyoming, Yellowstone National
                    Park and parts of Montana, our partnership with Air Idaho Rescue is an integral element to the care
                    we provide to both residents and tourists.”

                    Air Methods officials say the new base will be staffed by more than 16 crew members, including
                    pilots, nurses, paramedics and mechanics, and will provide medical services around the clock.
                    <br>
                    “In emergency situations that we are called to, minutes can be the differences between life and
                    death,” Air Methods area manager Mike Jenkins said in the news release. “We are excited to partner
                    with EIRMC to service Southeastern Idaho and the surrounding areas to ensure emergency medical care
                    is accessible to everyone in these communities. We would also like to thank Caribou Memorial
                    Hospital for their valued partnership and look forward to continued service to the residents of
                    Caribou County and the surrounding areas.”
