                Target Audience: <br>
                <br>
                Our target audience is anyone that has an adventurous spirit or anyone who enjoys the outdoors. We want
                to provide weather forecasts so that everyone can have the best outdoor experience possible without the
                worry of bad weather. <br>
                <br>
                Personas:
                <br>
                <br>
                Mike is 35 years old and is married with 5 kids. He and His wife Cindy used to go hiking and canoeing
                all the time when they were younger. Now with their 5 kids it makes things a little harder.
                Kelsie is a newly wed who lives for rock climbing with her husband Scott. They try to make time every
                weekend to be outdoors even with their busy sceduales. <br>
                <br>
                Scenarios: <br>
                <br>
                1. Mike and Cindy finally have a weekend off. They want to go to their hometown and have a nice picnic
                lunch in the park. They check the weather and see that it’s going to rain. They decide to move it to the
                next day so that they can have a sunny picnic instead of getting soaked.
                <br>
                2. Scott, Kelsie’s husband, wants to spend some time with his brother and go on a backpacking trip.
                Kelsie is concerned because she heard there might be a thunderstorm the same weekend they wanted to go.
                She checks the forecast and sees that it’s clear sky’s. Scott can go backpacking.
                <br>
                3. Mike and Cindy want to go camping with their family and check the forecast to see which weekend to
                go.
                <br>
                4. Kelsie wants to do an outdoor surprise party for Scott and checks to make sure it’s not going to rain
                on them.
                <br>
                5. Mike and Cindy meet Kelsie and Scott and want to go skiing with them. They shoot for the weekend but
                the weather forecast says no snow. They postpone the trip until they get a good snowstorm or two.
