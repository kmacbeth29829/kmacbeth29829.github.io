            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                Originally we had the idea for this <br>
                business from some of our best friends.They work in Temples for the Church of <br>
                Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and travel to different temples frequently. <br>
                One of the biggest struggles they have with this is trying to find a nice place <br>
                to stay. On some trips they need a place to stay for months, while others just a <br>
                few days. We strive to provide nice family friendly places to stay for anyone. <br>

            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>Open Sans is a very professional font that looks clean and modern and it will be <br>
                used for our headings. Quicksand is a little thinner and will be used for our paragraphs.
